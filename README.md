# Soil Moisture Monitoring System

## About

The Soil Moisture Monitoring System is an IoT project that enables real-time monitoring of soil moisture levels. The system utilizes a NodeMCU-32 development board, a soil moisture sensor, and Firebase to collect, store, and visualize the soil moisture data. This README provides an overview of the project and instructions for using the system.

## Project Usage

1. Access the Web Interface: Visit the following link to access the web interface for monitoring the soil moisture data: https://arduino-222cd.web.app/

2. View Soil Moisture Data: The web interface provides a visual representation of the current soil moisture level. The data is displayed in real-time, allowing users to monitor changes over time.

Please note that the system requires an internet connection for real-time data updates and communication with the Firebase backend. 
If you wish to connect your sensor and nodeMCU board you'll need to make changes in the PWS.ino file.
